# Novel Hybrid Transformer for CT ray reconstruction
Reconstructing Low Radiation CT Scans using Transformer and UNet Res Based Neural Networks

Research Problem and Real World impact

* 6.7 million CT scans performed in the year ending March 2022. (NHS, England)
* 375 million CT scans, worldwide each year. (UNSCEAR)(Wojcik, 2022)
* ~10% of medical imaging procedures, but 
* ~60% of Human medical radiation exposure (UNSCEAR)(Wojcik, 2022)
* Alternative, Low radiation scans are noisy and often lead to misdiagnosis.
* Our Research Problem is compiling a hybrid NN to reconstruct a clear CT image that
* can be reasonable alternative to a HDCT from Low Radiation DICOM X-ray projections.
